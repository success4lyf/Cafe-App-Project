# Cafe-App-Project

> A client has launched a pop-up cafÃ© in a busy business district. They are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to log and track orders.

## Client Requirements

As a business:
- I want to. maintain a collection of products and couriers.
- When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the system.
- I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered.
- When I exit myapp, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.
- When I start myapp, I need to. load all persisted data.
- I need  to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.
- I need  to receive regular software updates.

## Project Structure and D


### Mini Project Week 1

In this first week, the foundation of the app was built, in particular, the UI aspect to print to the screen, accept user input, and create a basic list data structure. The main menu and product menu options were created. Below is the week one code:

```python
"""
class MainMenu:
    def __init__(self, exit, menu_option):
        self.exit = exit
        self.menu_option = menu_option
        self.order_list = []
        print('\n' * 2)
        print('*' * 10 + ' ' + '\x1B[1m' + 'WELCOME TO OUR POP-UP CAFE APP!' + '\x1B[0m' + ' ' + '*' * 10)
        
    def get_main_menu(self):
        while True:
            print('\n')
            print('*' * 5 + ' ' + '\x1B[1m' + 'MAIN MENU:' + '\x1B[0m' + ' ' + '*' * 5 + '\n')
            for i, menu in enumerate(menu_option):
                print(f'{i} -> {menu}')
